# RomCom

A boilerplate repo. 

## Set Up
1. ONE teammate: fork this boilerplate repository 
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal
6. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository

You will not need to worry about importing/exporting the arrays from the data.js file because they are linked via the script in the `index.html` file.  

The project spec & rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/romcom-pair.html)

# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The website we have built is designed to create romance novel covers. This allows users to not only generate covers randomly using pre-defined assets, but also to create covers from scratch, using their own images and words. Users can additionally save multiple covers at once, allowing them to compare and contrast different designs, and delete them by double-clicking, if they happen to dislike something. This allows users to quickly and easily create a mock-up of whatever overly-romantic slop they happen to be writing. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
There is absolutely no requirement that you have to clone it at all! Using the deployment, you can use an online version of this webpage without any further hassle.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
There were 5 days we had to work on the project. We are in Mod 1 Week 2.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project included honing our ability to write clean, dry javascript, to explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to learn how to write code collaboratively. We made use of Visual Studio Code's live share module to work at the same time, and slack allowed us to talk and share our screens as we did so.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

One of our biggest challenges was that we wrote our event listeners as a .onclick, then had to covert to .addEventListener in order to make iteration 4 function. Additionally, we had quite a bit of trouble with the style, at least at first; initially, we were using the .style method to change various parts of the page, and when we realized that we had to use the classes instead, that required a pretty big rewrite of our code. Managing to change everything so that it functioned properly using just the addition and subtraction of classes was a pretty big win for us! Furthermore, solving the problem of how to properly delete covers felt pretty amazing.
